### PdfBuilder ###

PdfBuilder is still a project just getting off the ground. The impetus for this project comes from my desire to make programmatically creating PDF files more fluent and readable. Under the hood, this project is just a wrapper around the iTextSharp library. The plan is to release this project on NuGet soon.
